<!--I really just took the light fury files and changed them a little. after messing around with skeletonmaster.xml, and format_description.xml I decided that I didn't actually want to go through an entire class and change stuff, but with the CTC stuff and other things Light fury is actually a pretty complete example of what you can do, and how to do it.-->
